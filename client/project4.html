                <p>The Hunters Point Shipyard Artists (HPSA) is an organization of about 250 artists who rent studios in a former US naval base in San Francisco. HPSA was looking to engage with the larger community while providing exposure to their art. Simultaneously, community members wanted an opportunity to engage more intimately with the artists. <br/><br/> 2 week sprint - Team of 3 Designers <br/><br/> 2 week sprint - Myself </p>

                    <p>The Hunters Point Shipyard Artists (HPSA) website caters to artists as well as the people who support their art, but it fails to connect and engage these two groups <br/><br/> The website (shipyardartists.com) provides information about Open Studio, a large event that takes place twice a year. The website also gives people year-round access to their artist directory. However, the shipyard artists would like to provide more exposure to their art and engage with people on an ongoing basis, not just at the very popular (and crowded) Open Studio events. Furthermore, artists want to develop better connections with their fellow HPSA community members. <br/><br/> With this in mind, the scope of the problem that HPSA was faced with seemed to be a tremendous one- one that my team and I sought out to validate and understand from multiple perspectives. </p>

                    To ideate an appropriate solution, we had to make sure that the needs of all users of the HPSA website were met. Since the goal was to foster more engagement and connection between the shipyard artists and their supporters, the solution would never be one-sided. Our idea to address HPSA’s problem was to emulate the crowdfunding idea that sites like Kickstarter use to fund projects. Instead of funding with money, visitors to the HPSA website would be able to join a small, intimate event that would require a minimum number of participants in order for it to take place. In the event page, visitors can see how many participants have already joined the event and how many are still needed for the event to be official. <br/><br/>


                    This idea addresses the art-supporters’ problem by making them feel that their opinion counts and that they have valuable time with artists. It would also be an incentive for the visitor to share the link to the event, via social media or email, if they truly want the event to happen. On the artist’s side, this solution would also be a win since they have control over what the event will be, when it will be, as well as assurance that it will be worth their time because of the confirmed number of participants, something that research showed us was very important to them.

                    <p> Agile approach with user and business at the center


                    Research Strategy
                    We performed contextual inquiries with the artists in the shipyard in order to understand the core users of the website. We gathered a robust amount of qualitative data that helped us understand their pain points, motivations and goals when using the HPSA website. We then proceeded to explore these same concepts but from the eyes of the visitors looking to support or learn about the shipyard artists. For this, we used interviews and surveys. As a result, we learned that indeed, artists want to provide more exposure to their art and engage with the community while art-supporters want smaller, more intimate events to be able to connect with local artists.

                    Synthesizing the Data
                    So, we had to make sense of the enormous amount of information we had gathered. To tackle this, my teammates and I created affinity maps that showed us key themes within our data, and empathy maps which helped us understand the feelings and thoughts our users had while they used the HPSA website. We condensed these findings to create primary personas, one for the artists and one for the art-supporters. These personas enables us to pursue a user-centered approach to our design process. As for service design, the offline solution portion will be the social media integration and partnership with vendors for more food trucks and possibly hosting San Francisco’s Off The Grid.
